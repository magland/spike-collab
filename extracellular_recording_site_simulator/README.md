# Extracellular Recording Site Simulator

Tool for creating a biophysically realistic recording site given a probe geometry and brain region. Currently supports the Neuropixels probe and the Somatosensory cortex column brain region of a rat.
 

## Getting Started

Read/run the notebook example in the cortex_simulation folder for a breakdown of how the code works.

### Uses

This software was designed as an intial step in creating brain/probe specific evaluation datasets for
spike sorting. It allows for realistic generation of extracellular recording sites for different probe geometries within different brain regions.

### Future Work

More probes will be implemented (Neuroseeker, H-Series, tetrodes,  etc.) along with more brain regions (hippocampus, thalamus, etc.) and more animals (mouse).
