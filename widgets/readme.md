## A collection of jupyter widgets that use the input and output extractors

Each widget should...

* Be in its own directory

* Operate on InputExtractor and OutputExtractor objects rather than files directly

* Have at least one .ipynb file that demonstrates basic usage.

* Have documentation that describes prerequisites for running

* If the demo notebook requires data, it should ideally be small and auto-download from the internet
