# spike-collab

A brainstorming/sandbox repository facilitating collaboration on spike sorting comparison and validation.

This repository resulted from a call with Jeremy Magland, Alessio Buccino, Espen Hagen, Matthias Henning, and Cole Hurwitz.

Let's start putting some code, documentation, links, etc.

## Guidelines for now

* Let's not worry too much about the structure as we can reorganize it later.
* Pull requests are good, but at the early stages it's okay to simply push to the repo when modifying files that are primarily owned by a single contributor

## Documents in this repo

* [miscellaneous_links.md](docs/miscellaneous_links.md)
