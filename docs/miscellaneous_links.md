## Miscellaneous

* [Spike sorter comparison white paper](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikesortercomparison) -- Some choices for metrics and datasets for a community effort to compare and validate the major spike sorting packages, hosted at Flatiron. This includes summarizing and extending some ideas from the discussion at the Janelia spike sorting meeting of 3/22/18.

* [MountainLab/MountainSort examples](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort_examples) -- Examples of using MountainLab and MountainSort via JupyterLab, Singularity containers, etc.

* [Neo](http://neuralensemble.org/neo/) -- Neo is a package for representing electrophysiology data in Python, together with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats, including Spike2, NeuroExplorer, AlphaOmega, Axon, Blackrock, Plexon, Tdt, and support for writing to a subset of these formats plus non-proprietary formats including HDF5.

* [evalSort](https://github.com/alejoe91/evalSort) -- Python utility for evaluation of spike sorting performance.

* [NoWorkflow](https://pypi.org/project/noworkflow/) -- Provenance framework for Python: The noWorkflow project aims at allowing scientists to benefit from provenance data analysis even when they donâ€™t use a workflow system. Also, the goal is to allow them to avoid using naming conventions to store files originated in previous executions. It uses Software Engineering techniques such as abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis, reflection, and profiling, to collect provenance without the need of a version control system or any other environment.

* Ideas for publishing data and content via Github from the [York lab](https://andrewgyork.github.io/).
